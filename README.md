# Client-Journey-Model
A model of the growth path to start a business from idea to traction
I am trying to create a pathway to guide entrepreneurs to develop a business idea into a business concept which has been validated based on a model I developed. The model consuists of a client journey map and 5 sets of touchpoints depending on the business type
I would like to create an app or tool that one could use to diditise the concept and process so that it can be used by a business development mentor or coach to guide clients.
The Mentor could track the clients progress using the app and the client would be able to contribute validated material to the various steps to help in creating a business model and ultimately a business plan.
