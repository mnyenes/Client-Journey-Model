# Client-Journey-Model
A model of the growth path to start a business from idea to traction
I am trying to create a pathway to guide entrepreneurs to develop a business idea into a validated business concept, based on a model I developed. 
The model consists of a client journey map and 5 sets of touchpoints dependent on the business type
I would like to create an app or tool that one could use to utilise to follow the process so that it can be used together with a business development mentor or coach giving guidance to the clients.
The Mentor could track the clients progress using the app and the client would be able to contribute validated material to the various touchpoint steps to help in creating a business model and ultimately a business plan.
This way we can document the progress of the client as they complete a specific touchpoint and provide mentoring and guidance for the next touchpoint.
Once they have created and validated the assumptions for each touchpoint they would have created a value proposition for their business, which is based on facts.
